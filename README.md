## 🔐 Authentication

* JWT-based authentication
* Roles assigned during user registration
* Unauthorized access returns friendly error message

> `"You are not logged in to use this endpoint"`

---

## 🛠️ Backend Setup (ASP.NET Core)

1. Clone the repository

2. Update the database connection in `appsettings.json`

3. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

---

## 💻 Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) if needed.

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

> 💡 The frontend will auto-reload and preview changes instantly.
